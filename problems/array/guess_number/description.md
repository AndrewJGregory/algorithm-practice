# GUESS NUMBER

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

```
-1 : My number is lower
1 : My number is higher
0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

Example :

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
