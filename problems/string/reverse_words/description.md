# REVERSE WORDS IN A STRING

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

Example:

```
Input: "the sky is blue",
Output: "blue is sky the".
```

Note:

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
