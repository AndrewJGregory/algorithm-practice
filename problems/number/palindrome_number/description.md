Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. <br>

Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: true
```

Example 1:
```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Example 1:
```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
